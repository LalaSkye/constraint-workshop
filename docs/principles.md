# Principles

- Determinism over optimisation.
- Small primitives > frameworks (single file + tests).
- Explicit state machines; terminal states are absorbing.
- Authority is ordered and monotone.
- Classification ≠ verification (posture only, not truth).
- No orchestration, no selection logic, no policy engines.
- Tests are mandatory; CI is the contract.
- Public repo contains bricks only; composition remains out of scope.
